I am a California native. Born in Walnut Creek and lived there for most of my life. For a short period, I lived in El Paso, Texas and later moved to
Mililani, Hawaii. Then I moved back to California for the rest of middle school and high school. I later moved to Pittsburgh, PA to study at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am confortable with traveling, seeing new places, and meeting new people.<br><br>

When I lived in Hawaii, I joined a local competitive swimming club. Since then, I have been swimming competitively, qualifying for regional and 
national level championships. While I was at Carnegie Mellon, I qualified for NCAA championship meet 3 out of my 4 years. Swimming forced me to manage my time with work and practice,
eat a healthy life style, and keep me in shape. <br><br>

In my free time, I like to play frisbee golf. There is a course walking distance from my house. I started playing a couple months ago and still trying to grasp the basics. 
It's very relaxing and its nice to play in the summer. Alternatively, I also like to play video games with my friends. In particular, I play the MOBA League of Legends. 
Its a fast pace multiplayer battle arena game.
